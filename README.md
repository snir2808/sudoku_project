Hi my name is Snir.
I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see.
I built this project as part of a mid-course test.
I built a sudoku game here.
The system creates a sudoku board and "clears" values from it according to the degree of difficulty the user selects.
I tell you from the beginning everything can be solved :)
Wish you a pleasant use :)
